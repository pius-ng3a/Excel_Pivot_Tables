# Introduction
Pivot tables are key to data insights generation when analysing data using excel. 
This project demonstrates the use of pivot tables to summarize data about product
sales, and building of a dashboard that showing the insights in easy to digest formats. 
The data is that of a vendor that sells products across different regions of the world.

# Pivot table generation
In this exercise, we want to find out how the company's profit is distributed across countries over the years
the data was captured. We equally want to be able to zoom in to see profit statistics by product as well as by 
different states/regions in a country. These are handled using filters. The image below shows the resulting pivot
table with profits for each country across the years.

Figure 1. Pivot table showing profits generated over years by country. 

From the table, one sees that the United states is the country that patronizes the business the most throughout the 
entire period, followed by the Australia, while France is the least.

* Using the filters, one can view contributions by gender or product. The contribution by gender (as seen in the pictures
  below) show that, overall, the male population generate slightly more profit than the female population.

## Zooming into states/regional contributions
Here, the business owner is interested in knowing which regions are most beneficial to the business. This information 
can help shape campaign strategy to improve sales or serve as insights to further diagnose the challenges faced by clients
in some states leading to low profit generation. This would then shape the actions to reduce churn and improve profit in those
states. 

In the image below, we zoom into states in the United States (the most profitable country for the business) and examine business
success in different states.

Figure 3. Profit generated by state for the most profitable country - USA. 

From the figure, the most profitable state is California, followed by Washington while Alabama and North Carolina top the list from 
the bottom.
* By comparing marketing efforts in these states, a strategy could be put in place to drive more leads and thus profit.

# Building a dashboard 
Figures are more challenging to grasp. Reprenting insights using visuals makes it easier for stakeholders to quickly understand and
interpret data. For this exercise, I have built a simple dashboard to display key insights about the business' profits.

Figure 4. Dashboard for Business profits insights

By looking at the dashboard, one can draw the following concludions. 
* Generally, profit generated in each country increased from 2011 to 2016. Only Australia withnessed a drop at the end of the period. Why?
* The United States contributes slightly over a third (35%) of the entire profit for the period considered, followed by Australia with 25%.   

Using the filters, one can view the data by attributes for detailed insights. The figure below displays profits for the year 2011 only.
