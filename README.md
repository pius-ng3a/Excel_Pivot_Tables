# Introduction
Pivot tables are key to data insights generation when analysing data using excel. 
This project demonstrates the use of pivot tables to summarize data about product
sales, and building of a dashboard that showing the insights in easy to digest formats. 
The data is that of a vendor that sells products across different regions of the world.

# Pivot table generation
In this exercise, we want to find out how the company's profit is distributed across countries over the years
the data was captured. We equally want to be able to zoom in to see profit statistics by product as well as by 
different states/regions in a country. These are handled using filters. The image below shows the resulting pivot
table with profits for each country across the years.

Figure 1. Pivot table showing profits generated over years by country. 

From the table, one sees that the United states is the country that patronizes the business the most throughout the 
entire period, followed by the United kindom, while Australia is the least.
